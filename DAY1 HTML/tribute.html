          Association (HSRA) at the age of 16 and became a prominent figure in

          Bhagat Singh was born on September 27, 1907, in Banga, a small village
          in present-day Pakistan. His family was deeply involved in the Indian
          independence movement, and he grew up in a politically charged
          atmosphere. His father, Kishan Singh, was a prominent Sikh leader and
          his uncle, Ajit Singh, was a well-known revolutionary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bhagat Singh received his early education at home and later attended

          economics, and politics. During his college days, he was drawn towards
          revolutionary ideas and became involved in various student

        <h2>Political Activism</h2>
        <p>
          Bhagat Singh was a fierce critic of British colonialism and
          imperialism. He believed in using revolutionary means to overthrow
          British rule in India.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1928, Bhagat Singh and his comrades, Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev
          Thapar, were involved in the assassination of John Saunders, a British
          police officer who was responsible for the brutal lathi charge on Lala
          Lajpat Rai. Bhagat Singh and his associates surrendered after the
          incident and were sentenced to death.

            Our movement is passing through a very important phase at present. After a year's fierce struggle some definite proposals regarding the constitutional reforms have been formulated by the Round Table Conference and the Congress leaders have been invited to give this [Original transcription is unclear -- MIA Transcriber]…think it desirable in the present circumstances to call off their movement. Whether they decide in favour or against is a matter of little importance to us. The present movement is bound to end in some sort of compromise. The compromise may be effected sooner or later. And compromise is not such ignoble and deplorable an thing as we generally think. It is rather an indispensable factor in the political strategy. Any nation that rises against the oppressors is bound to fail in the beginning, and to gain partial reforms during the medieval period of its struggle through compromises. And it is only at the last stage — having fully organized all the forces and resources of the nation — that it can possibly strike the final blow in which it might succeed to shatter the ruler's government. But even then it might fail, which makes some sort of compromise inevitable. This can be best illustrated by the Russian example.

        <h2>Imprisonment and Death</h2>
        <p>
          Bhagat Singh and his comrades were held in Lahore Central Jail and
          were subjected to inhumane treatment. Bhagat Singh went on a hunger
          strike to protest against the mistreatment of political prisoners and
          the British colonial government.
        </p>
        <p>
          On March 23, 1931, Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Thapar were hanged to
          death in Lahore jail. Their martyrdom inspired millions of Indians to
          join the freedom struggle.

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>

          <h2>Theater</h2>
           Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru have been the inspiration for a
          number of plays in India and Pakistan, that continue to attract
          crowds.[130][131][132].. 
          <h2>Songs</h2> Although not written by Singh, the
          patriotic Hindustani songs, "Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna" ("The desire to
          sacrifice") created by Bismil Azimabadi,[133] and "Mera Rang De
          Basanti Chola" ("O Mother! Dye my robe the colour of spring") created
          by Ram Prasad Bismil,[134] are largely associated with him and have
          been used in a number of related films.[135] 
          <h2>Other</h2> In 1968, a postage
          stamp was issued in India commemorating the 61st birth anniversary of
          Singh.[136] A ₹5 coin commemorating him was released for circulation
          in 2012.[137] Bhagat Singh's writings and speeches continue to inspire
          people to fight against oppression and injustice. His ideas and
          beliefs have a significant influence on the socialist and communist
          movements in India.
